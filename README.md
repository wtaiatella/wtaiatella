### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Wagner, enthusiastic about programming, I spent good part of my professional career programming equipment for substation automation, but I always wanted something more. After get contact with web development because a personal project, I realized that this is the career I want to pursue going forward.

Like every programmer, I'm always looking for the best solutions to programming problems using the most current tools available. For this I have been looking for courses that offer the development of modern solutions focusing on the most used frameworks in the market.
