On the start of my journey I worked as a substation automation programmer building robust solutions that would guarantee the safety of the electrical power system operation. At that time I developed control logics, performed tests on them and configured ethernet network architectures.

But some years ago I had the opportunity to learn a little about web development due a personal project and I loved it very much. After this, as a self-taught person with a lot of resilience, I became interested in the world of web development and in my spare time, with great help from Google and Developer Communities, I learned some important concepts about  HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, React, Nextjs, responsive web pages, APIs, Git an GitHub and React Components

Since then, I always search for new techniques to become a better programmer and to help me combine these technologies.

Throughout my studies I developed several pages and gathered here in this portfolio the ones I consider most important. Hope you like!!
