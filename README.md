On the start of my journey I worked as a substation automation programmer building robust solutions that would guarantee the safety of the electrical power system operation. At that time I developed control logics, performed tests on them and configured ethernet network architectures.

Iâ€™m an enthusiastic about programming, I love learning new things because I believe that leaving the comfort zone is what brings growth. Also, I'm excited about working with technologies for web development and I started my journey as a web developer in June 2021 that makes me already use some tools to develop some projects such as: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node and other topics about programming as responsive web pages, APIs, Git an GitHub and React Components and project documentation.

Here you can see some of pages I've developed during my studies.
