Enthusiastic about programming, I spent good part of my professional career programming equipment for the automation of power plant substations, but I always wanted something more. After I had contact with web development because of a personal project, I realized that this is the career I want to pursue going forward.

Like every programmer, I'm always looking for the best way to solve programming problems using the latest available tools. Considering this, I have been looking for courses that teach the development of modern solutions focusing on the most used frameworks in the market.

Actualy I'm working with SCADA System Development for Power Substation Control, but focus on learnig new tecnologies to change career...

Here you can see some of pages I've developed during my studies.
